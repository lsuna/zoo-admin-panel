# zoo-admin-panel
The Zoo Admin Panel was a project for my HCI course where we had to create an interface system for a Zoo. 
This system must indluce functionality to lock and unlock gates, turn on and off sprinklers, set a 
schedule for the sprinkler system, and create a feeder system. In addition, make a feature that
makes the animals grow hungry and not allow the user to overfeed them.
